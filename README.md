## **Typical Entities & Interactions**

1. **State-Level Organizations (e.g., Dept. of Environmental Quality)**
   - View and oversee reporting on sites managed by municipal entities.
   - Monitor compliance across jurisdictions.

2. **Municipal Entities (e.g., City/County Departments)**
   - Manage multiple sites under their jurisdiction.
   - Conduct inspections and enforce compliance with local ordinances.

## **Communication & Audit Trail**

Keeping a clear record of all communications and actions is a cornerstone of this system:
- **Violation Notifications**: Email, SMS, or in-app alerts to site owners.
- **Call Logs**: Record details of phone communications for audit purposes.
- **Messaging**: Direct messaging within the app, tied to specific sites or violations.
- **Printable Reports**: Generate detailed summaries of inspections, communications, and resolutions.

---

## **Site Management**

Administrators can create and manage various types of sites, with the following default types:
- **Residential Sites**: Individual lots in subdivisions where dirt is being cleared for house construction.
- **Large Sites**: Commercial developments, land tracts for subdivisions, or similar large-scale land clearing projects.

To simplify workflows:
- **Site Copying**: Duplicate existing site setups for faster creation of similar sites, particularly useful for subdivision lots.
- **Archival**: Retain site data for regulatory compliance and historical reference, even after the site becomes inactive.

---

## **Inspection Workflow**

Inspectors assess Best Management Practices (BMPs) at each site to ensure compliance with environmental standards.

- **BMP Management**:
  - **Standard BMPs**: Universal measures applied across all sites.
  - **Custom BMPs**: Site-specific measures that inspectors define as needed.

- **Dynamic Inspection Forms**:
  - Forms auto-generate fields based on standard and custom BMPs to streamline data collection.

- **Media Upload & Handling**:
  - Attach images, documents, and other media to inspection records for detailed documentation.

---

## **Reporting**

To comply with regulatory requirements and streamline communication, the application provides:
- **PDF Export**: Generate professional inspection reports for individual or bulk exports.
- **Violation Summary**: Highlight key findings and resolutions in an easy-to-read format.
- **Batch Reporting**: Export reports for multiple inspections simultaneously, reducing administrative overhead.

---

## **Future Vision**

- **Multi-Tenant Support**: Each organization will need to manage users and payments. Individual users should also be able to pay even if their organization isn‚Äôt formally paying. This is part of the early target market strategy (product-led growth).
- **Cross-Jurisdiction Insights**: Provide inspectors and organizations with visibility into broader compliance data.
- **Integrated Violation Resolution**: Facilitate back-and-forth communication to document corrective actions directly in the app.
- **MS4 Compliance and Reporting**: Facilitate and streamline MS4 reporting and compliance requirements.
