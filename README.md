## **Communication & Audit Trail**
Keeping a clear record of all communications and actions is a cornerstone of this system:
- **Violation Notifications**: Email, SMS, or in-app alerts to site owners.
- **Call Logs**: Record details of phone communications for audit purposes.
- **Messaging**: Direct messaging within the app, tied to specific sites or violations.
- **Printable Reports**: Generate detailed summaries of inspections, communications, and resolutions.

---
## **Site Management**
Administrators can manage various types of sites, including:
- **Residential Sites**: Individual lots in subdivisions where dirt is being cleared for house construction.
- **Large Sites**: Commercial developments, land tracts for subdivisions, or similar large-scale land clearing projects.

To simplify workflows:
- **Site Copying**: Duplicate existing site setups for faster creation of similar sites, particularly useful for subdivision lots.
- **Archival**: Retain site data for regulatory compliance and historical reference, even after the site becomes inactive.

## **Inspection Workflow**
Inspectors assess Best Management Practices (BMPs) at each site to ensure compliance with environmental standards.
- **BMP Management**:
  - **Standard BMPs**: Universal measures applied across all sites.
  - **Custom BMPs**: Site-specific measures that inspectors define as needed.

- **Dynamic Inspection Forms**:
  - Forms auto-generate fields based on standard and custom BMPs to streamline data collection.

- **Media Upload & Handling**:
  - Attach images, documents, and other media to inspection records for detailed documentation.

## **Reporting**
To comply with regulatory requirements and streamline communication, the application provides:
- **PDF Export**: Generate professional inspection reports for individual or bulk exports.
- **Violation Summary**: Highlight key findings and resolutions in an easy-to-read format.
- **Batch Reporting**: Export reports for multiple inspections simultaneously, reducing administrative overhead.


## **Future Vision**
- **Multi-Tenant Support**: Enable interactions across state, municipal, and private actors.
- **Cross-Jurisdiction Insights**: Provide inspectors and organizations visibility into broader compliance data.
- **Integrated Violation Resolution**: Facilitate back-and-forth communication to document corrective actions directly in the app.
